# Code 06: Linked List Insertions

### Features
- [x] .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- [x] .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- [x] .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

### Testing
- [x] Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- [ ] Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- [ ] Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

### Stretch Goal
- [ ] Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, write an additional method to delete a node with the given value from the linked list.
